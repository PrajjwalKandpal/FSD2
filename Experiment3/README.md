# EXPERIMENT 3 : Implement Routing in SPA

### 1. Explain the concept of client-side routing in Single Page Applications (SPAs) and distinguish it from server-side routing by analyzing page reload behavior, state preservation, and user experience.

### 2. Install, configure, and integrate React Router DOM (v6) into a React application to enable navigation without full-page refreshes.

### 3. Implement basic routing structures using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components to create multiple navigable pages such as Home, About, and Contact.

### 4. Design and implement navigation menus using Link and NavLink components, including active link styling for improved user experience.

### 5. Develop dynamic routes using URL parameters and access route data using hooks such as useParams to display content dynamically based on route values.

### 6. Apply nested routing techniques using layout components and the Outlet feature to build reusable page structures with shared headers, footers, or sidebars.

### 7. Implement programmatic navigation using the useNavigate hook to redirect users after actions such as login, logout, or form submission.

### 8. Design and secure protected routes by implementing authentication-based route guards that restrict access to authorized users only.

### 9. Handle invalid or undefined routes gracefully by implementing a custom 404 “Not Found” page using wildcard route matching.

### 10. Optimize routing performance and usability by applying best practices such as lazy loading routes, handling redirects, managing query parameters, and configuring servers for proper SPA deployment.
