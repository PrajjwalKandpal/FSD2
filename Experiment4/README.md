### 1. Understand about Local State with (useState) where learned about how to manage state inside a single component using useState(), and how React re-renders UI when state changes.

### 2. Come to know the difference between Local and Global State - (useState) is ideal for local component state, while Context API and Resux are used for shared/global state.

### 3. Learned about concept of State Updating and Re-Rendering - for example : state update {like setCount(count+1) } automatically trigger UI re-rendering in React.

### 4. Understand about Context APIs, Redux, Local State, Global State, etc.

### 5. Learned about the concept that how Context Provider Works - It wraps the application and supplies the shared state through value={{count, setCount}}.
